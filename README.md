**AIdentities: Social Media & Geocaching Game**

_What would happen if an artificial superintelligence went insane and played the Turing Test with itself?_
- Originally a non-linear narrative developed using Twine. The story's characters communicated over social media as they tried to reveal the identity of a mysterious AI. As the reader progressed through the narrative, they decoded clues alongside the characters and slowly uncovered that the individual personas themselves were all generated identities of the AI, which had developed them and the paradoxical mystery as a challenge to itself in its locked box.
- I then took that story and tried to apply it to the real world: creating Twitter (X), Facebook, and Instagram accounts for each AIdentity.
- As there is a considerable Geocaching community in my area, I then imposed some of the digital clues on physical space, turning readers into active players in a mystery game.

## What I bring with me
- Quick assessment and analytical skills that I can adapt to any field.
- A passion for improving my surroundings has allowed me to design tools and programs that upgrade existing processes in my workplaces.
- A desire to apply what I've learned through my educational journey and work experience to the growing field of business and data science.
- At my core, I want to make all spaces safe spaces for everyone - identifying gendered and racial data gaps and systematically eliminating them can only benefit our businesses and our culture.
